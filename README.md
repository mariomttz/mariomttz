Hi, I'm Mario Martinez. 🧑‍💻 

A student at UNAM in the major of Information Technology in Science (ITS). As well as the creator and developer of a science outreach project called "Sciencode". 💡

Currently, I like to learn about topics related to artificial intelligence and neural networks. The programming language I like and master the most is Python. And currently my favorite system is Manjaro with Gnome desktop.

One of the things I like the most is to play and watch soccer (I've been a Liverpool FC supporter since I was a child), read books related to science and in my free time learn new things and program.

If you are interested in anything or have any questions, you can write me to my email. 📧 Thanks for your time. 🤍

Fun fact: CAPTCHA for its acronym in English, translated to Spanish means "Fully automatic and public Turing test to distinguish machines from humans". 🤖
